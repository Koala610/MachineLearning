            <p>A <span class="Victorine-victorine">Victorine</span> is a game of answering oral or written questions from various fields of knowledge.
                <br>
                <span class="Victorine-victorine">Victorine</span> basically differ from each other by the rules that determine the order of the move, 
                the type and difficulty of the question, 
                the procedure for determining the winners, 
                and the reward for the correct answer.
                <br>
                There are board quizzes with pre-prepared questions. Very often on the board game market, 
                several versions of the same game are presented at the same time, differing in a set (often level of difficulty) of questions. 
                There are also additional question sets sold separately from the game.</p>
